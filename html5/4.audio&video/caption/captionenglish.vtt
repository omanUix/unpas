00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.979
hello hello friends everyone is back again

2
00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.529
on the playlist learn HTML5 with me

3
00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.839
sandhika Galih in this blog at

4
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.710
In the 4th episode we will discuss about

5
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.599
audio and video yes friends so

6
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.120
these elements or these technologies constitute

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.270
new technologies in HTML5 we will

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.150
Let's discuss them one by one. starting with tags

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.900
audio so Tego This is a text

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.570
or elements that represent sound

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.869
or audio stream to create a

12
00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.910
This audio element is quite easy

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.860
our friends just call

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.410
c or write the text then

15
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.930
Write down the attributes that must be present. namely

16
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.960
src or source is where we store it

17
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
the audio file then we can add

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.750
controls attribute to add

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.430
controls for play pause or scroll

20
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.789
yes or make us shift the position

21
00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.890
the audio and we can also adjust it

22
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.329
volume in that uses audio captions

23
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.910
like this is enough or if

24
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.799
for example. we want to be more complex

25
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.560
you can insert it into figure text like

26
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.670
which we discussed in the video

27
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.979
Previously we could also insert

28
00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.310
Other multimedia elements are images viz

29
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.000
audio yes David caption Then there is audio

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.940
These and the audio tags are different

31
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.220
with IMG. yes. if yikan doesn't exist

32
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.070
the lid with audio has a closing tag

33
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.170
Well. in the heart of the audio we can

34
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.530
write text when this audio or

35
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.960
This tag is not supported by the browser

36
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.580
So if the browser doesn't support it

37
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.039
The audio that will appear is written

38
00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.920
The browser doesn't support you

39
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.030
guys. we'll try it later

40
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.610
practice writing this audio text

41
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.590
Now let's see what the attributes are

42
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.440
this is all we can use

43
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.659
in this audio text the first of course

44
00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.640
we just need this source

45
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.740
The second mandatory attribute is that we can

46
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.080
provide controls so that users can

47
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.030
controlling Saudi Onya using

48
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.039
the default controller. Well. for example

49
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.170
we won't use that control later

50
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.258
Maudio won't function

51
00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.410
or controlled using javascript

52
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.209
next there is this preload to create

53
00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.180
The audio file is loaded first

54
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.910
run because the default has audio

55
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.430
it is loaded when we press the button

56
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.819
next play there is a topley out for

57
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.459
run audio automatically there

58
00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.980
Loop to repeat the audio when

59
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.890
it's reached the end. okay? So if not

60
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.470
use it. forget it. just stop at one

61
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.780
times but if you use Loop later

62
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.940
the audio keeps playing. the last one

63
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.150
Adam n is this for making audio?

64
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.069
there's sound yeah So this is for

65
00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.140
The following attributes are several

66
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.540
note for this audio heart

67
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.190
first clear Was used for

68
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.590
run audio files of which there are several

69
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.780
we can use the adion file

70
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.180
first
